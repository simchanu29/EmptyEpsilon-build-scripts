# Vagrant scripts for Empty Espilon #

I've narrowed support down to ubuntu 18.04 in anticipation for ubuntu 20.04 and to debian 10 (buster).

These scripts will build a windows, debian/ubuntu (respectively) .deb file, and an apk for android.

I suggest the following to add the vagrant packages I have installed:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize`
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
